Unveiling Nvidia's Future Growth: AI Capex and Blackwell Delays üöÄ
I Data in Action
All Eyes on nVidia
nVidia‚Äôs August 28 earnings may bring volatility due to AI capex, Blackwell delays, and monetization concerns.
When nVidia reports on August 28th, expect heightened volatility as options implied volatility sits at 15% versus a 10% two-year average. Two divergent themes are at play: (1) Continued strong AI-fueled capex led by the technology titans Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft juxtaposed against (2) a delayed next-generation product Blackwell. With the stock up 20% since they reported their
nVidia CEO Jensen Huang first unveiled the Blackwell platform at GTC in mid-March, stating the platform has 4x better training performance and 30x better inference than the current Hooper line. The platform was expected to ship later this year with material contribution in their January quarter. The Information reported early this month that the Blackwell platform was experiencing design flaws and, as a result, will be delayed by at least three months.
With nVidia riding high on AI-fueled growth, the looming question is: can they maintain momentum or will the Blackwell delay cast a shadow on their future?

[Subject: How the antitrust lawsuit against NVDA will impact it, and other companies]
[From: Boosted.ai Team <sales-team@boosted.ai>]

[Chunk: 264]

Hi Sumin,
Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, approved in 2020, is under scrutiny in China for potentially violating antitrust rules. The $7 billion deal is being looked over by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China. The potential impacts - both through NVDA's market cap and as a microcosm of China-US relations - are far reaching.
We used our agentic AI tool - Alfa‚Ñ¢ - to create an automation that reads the news, every filing in the Russell 1000 and outputs the potential impacts of this suit and the stocks affected. Here‚Äôs the report Alfa‚Ñ¢ created, or, the Alfa‚Ñ¢ Angle.
Brainstormed impacts of a Chinese antitrust lawsuit against NVDA
Nvidia's Mellanox Acquisition Under Chinese Antitrust Scrutiny
- The Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, focusing on its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company specializing in networking technology. 
- The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China is scrutinizing whether Nvidia has adhered to the conditions set during the 2020 approval of the Mellanox deal, which required Nvidia to treat Chinese companies on par with others globally.
- This investigation is part of a broader context of escalating tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. The investigation is seen as a retaliatory measure against recent U.S. actions aimed at restricting China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. 
- These U.S. measures include export controls that limit the sale of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, which has significantly impacted Nvidia's revenue from the Chinese market. Despite these restrictions, Nvidia continues to generate substantial revenue from less advanced chips that it is still permitted to sell in China.
- The conditions imposed by Chinese regulators during the Mellanox acquisition included commitments to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. Nvidia was also required to allow customers and distributors to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The investigation will assess Nvidia's compliance with these commitments, including whether Mellanox has been revealing new product details to rivals within 90 days of their launch, as stipulated.
- This probe is part of a larger pattern of regulatory actions by China, which has previously targeted other foreign technology firms in response to international trade tensions. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for Nvidia's operations in China and its global business strategy.
Impact on Nvidia's AI Chip Market Dominance
- The Chinese antitrust investigation into Nvidia poses a significant threat to the company's dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia, which has been a leader in AI chip technology, accounting for 90% of global sales by the end of last year, is now under s...

Hey Sumin, 
Welcome to this week‚Äôs Exploding Topics Pro report. 
In this report‚Ä¶ 
Early bird companies: Scandinavian Biolabs, Cleanspark, Moonkie, Quandela. 
Tomorrow‚Äôs products today: Supply chain digital twin, AI dashcam, carbon plated shoes, blue light sunscreen. 
Do you have any feedback? We‚Äôd love to hear what you think. Just respond to let us know. 
Early Bird Companies 
Scandinavian Biolabs (website , search trend )
Scandinavian Biolabs is a hair growth startup. 
They use a drug-free and clinically tested ‚Äúactivation serum‚Äù to stimulate fuller and thicker hair. The product comes with a money-back guarantee if results are not visible within 150 days. 
In one study, 97% of users experienced less hair loss, while 73% saw a clinically tested increase in hair density. 
Over 100K men and women have used Scandinavian Biolabs products. 
Revenue is on track to hit $12-$13M this year, up from $8M in 2023. 
What‚Äôs next:
Scandinavian Biolabs is part of the Hair Growth Serums meta trend. 
Worldwide, 85% of men and 33% of women are affected by hair loss at some point in their lives. In the U.S., 65% of men will suffer hair loss by the age of 35. 
There‚Äôs rising interest in several ingredients and tools related to hair growth. The market as a whole is projected to be worth $12B by 2028. 
Here are two trending hair growth serum startups: 
Monpure is a luxury U.K. brand producing ‚Äúfollicle boost hair density serum‚Äù that uses pumpkin seed extract to block the production of a hair loss hormone called DHT. 
Moerie offers an ‚Äúultimate hair boost ‚Äù spray serum that brings in $44K in sales each month on Amazon. 
Cleanspark (website , search trend )
Cleanspark is a Bitcoin mining company. 
Mining Bitcoin is notoriously energy-intensive, but Cleanspark pledges to ‚Äúleave the planet better than we found it‚Äù by running their data centers on low-carbon power . 
They have mining facilities in five states, each one strategically located in communities with abundant clean energy. 
Cleanspark began its bitcoin mining operation in December 2020 . 
Revenue grew 125% last year to reach almost $380M, with approximately 7.1K Bitcoin mined. 
This year, Cleanspark anticipates hitting a 50 EH/s hash rate , meaning they have the computational power to perform 50 calculations per second. 
What‚Äôs next:
Cleanspark is part of the Sustainable Crypto meta trend. 
Mining Bitcoin alone uses an estimated 63 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, approximately the same as Poland‚Äôs entire annual energy consumption. 
One solution is creating new coins that are not reliant on massive computational power. Coins like Chia and Algorand are mined differently than Bitcoin, with a lower environmental impact. 
But the value of Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Much of the focus is therefore on how it can be mined sustainably. 
Terawulf , a popular Bitcoin mining corporation, uses 91% zero-carbon power at its Lake Mariner site in New York. The company posted 42.8% revenue growth in Q3 2024.

FADU is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in datacenters, which are growing in
demand due to the explosive data increase from cloud, AI/Big data, 5G, autonomous driving
etc. FADU core products are SSD Controllers used in datacenters. In datacenters, Solid State
Drives(SSDs), which are high-performance data storage devices based on NAND memory
semiconductors, are rapidly replacing HDDs, the traditional mechanical data storage device. NAND memory has the advantage of being a non-volatile semiconductor and very low cost,
but it suffers from slow speeds and poor durability. Due to these characteristics of NAND, the role of the SSD Controller, the brain of the SSD
module, is critical to ensuring the high levels of performance, reliability, and low power/low
thermal features that hyperscale datacenters require. FADU is the design company of this SSD
Controller. Our flagship products are the best-in-class performing PCIe NVMe enterprise SSD Controller
Solutions and enterprise SSDs(SSD ODMs) powered by our controllers, which are compatible with

[Subject: Question about Your AI Needs]
[From: Rui Ma <rui@alphawatch.ai>]
[Date: 2024-6-26]
[Chunk: 1330]
[Email Body Content:]
Hi Sumin,

[Chunk: 1333]
[DOCX Content:]
Attending industry events and trade shows provides opportunities to learn a lot, especially from mid-level engineers who are often more willing to share detailed technical knowledge. Unless you spend time on the ground in China, driving various EV models, testing charging infrastructure and connectivity, and experiencing autonomous driving capabilities, it's very difficult for Westerners to truly comprehend the affordable quality and relentless competitive pace of innovation happening in the Chinese auto industry. Question: Can you provide a comprehensive overview of the global EV market and the total market opportunity? If we look at from a 30,000 foot level, light vehicle sales globally is about 80.0 million a year. And China does about 30.0 million, but that's including shipment overseas. Last year, it was 9.5 million NEVs shipped from China. If we look at the 3 big regions - China, Europe, and North America - China is by far the leader. Last year was, like, a third of vehicles were NEVs in China. Europe a little bit less, maybe a little bit less than 20%. I think US last year was not quite 10%, close to 10%. So basically 50% let's say the NEVs are from China. They're shipped from China.

[Chunk: 1334]
[DOCX Content:]
That's basically the current kind of landscape. Question: Can you share the background for some of the key manufacturers in China, such as BYD, Nio, and Xiaomi? BYD is the largest Chinese EV manufacturer. It was founded by a chemical engineer about 30 years ago and started out as a battery supplier for companies like Nokia. They have built their expertise in batteries over the past 20-30 years. When we talk about the Chinese EV makers like BYD and NIO, they are exporting and selling in many more countries now compared to just 3 or 4 years ago. For example, BYD now has production plants set up globally in places like Hungary, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. Nio, XPeng, and Li Auto are considered the top 3 "smart EV startups" in China. They were all founded about 10 years ago by tech entrepreneurs and are known for their focus on technology. For example, Nio is known for its battery swapping stations, XPeng for its autonomous driving capabilities, and Li Auto for extended range electric vehicles. Xiaomi recently launched its first EV model that aims to compete with premium models like the Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S, despite likely being priced under 300,000 RMB which is a very competitive part of the EV market in China. Question: How do you assess the competitive dynamics between the Chinese EV makers like BYD versus Tesla? I often say that why the Chinese have gotten to where they are are several t's - affordability, quality, availability, and agility. The availability of Chinese EVs, not only in China but elsewhere in the world, was an important driver behind their rise over the last 2 years. And then there's the China speed - how fast they iterate their models and vehicles and how fast they launch multiple models within a short period of time. This speed is something the foreign automakers really can't compete with. When it comes to Tesla, they have been able to stay strong with only 2 products - the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla has a huge aura for their brand, as evidenced by the recent Cybertruck tour craziness across 8 cities in China. This brand pull is still very strong for them. But I think the Chinese automakers are covering all different market segments, from small micro vehicles to $150,000 premium vehicles. The Chinese companies are also becoming more confident in launching premium brands as they now have more technical prowess and innovations that are starting to appear first in China before anywhere else. This relentlessness of the Chinese companies is not only pushing the foreign automakers, but becoming a benchmark that these companies need to catch up to. That's why you see partnerships emerging between companies like Volkswagen and XPeng. I think we're in the midst of a prolonged price war that will continue until brands without the financial capabilities are driven out. This war is so cutthroat that even BYD, as the market leader, has had to lower prices and accept lower margins. Question: What's the one thing you know abou...

This is very important. At the same time, behind the scenes they are preparing to enter the passenger vehicle market. They recently brought over some U8 SUVs into the US for local testing and to potentially show them to investors and dealerships. I have even driven BYD's Han sedan and Tang SUV models here in the US. So they have been doing some local testing and are looking for the right moment to make an announcement about entering the US passenger vehicle market, either by directly importing from China and eating the current 27.5% tariffs, or using Mexico as a free trade springboard to produce vehicles there and export them tariff-free to North America under NAFTA. This latter approach may irk the US given the tensions with China, so there will likely be a lot of scrutiny. But one way or another, I think it's just a matter of time before BYD enters the US passenger vehicle market alongside other Chinese brands. Question: Does BYD have its own car operating system, its own AI, or self-driving car division? When you talk about BYD, you think of batteries because that's where they started out as a battery company. In terms of robotics, AI, and the vertical integration of autonomous driving and operating systems, BYD is slightly behind other companies. That's why you're seeing collaborations like BYD working with DJI, the drone company that is becoming a force in driver assistance and ADAS features. BYD recently held an event showing their R&D prowess and they are catching up on the autonomous driving aspect. However, I would still say Tesla is probably ahead in claiming and bragging about AI with things like Dojo, Optimus, and Elon Musk's various other startups. But at the same time, BYD's globalization and the tsunami of multiple different EV models hitting different markets is more prevalent than what we see from Tesla. Question: How would Tesla be adapting their strategies in response to the growing presence of Chinese EV makers? Tesla would continue their tactic of making incremental improvements and lacking models in the near term, such as potentially launching the Model 2 next year to compete in China. However, it remains to be seen whether the Model 2 could successfully compete on affordability compared to Chinese EVs. Tesla is also using China as an export base by ramping up production capacity with plans to invest $10 billion in CapEx in China in 2023. This includes expanding the Shanghai factory which was mentioned a couple dozen times in Tesla's recent 10k filing. So Tesla sees China as crucial to their global growth strategy. At the same time, Tesla is benefiting from the strong brand aura and customer excitement in China, as evidenced by the recent Cybertruck tour drawing massive crowds. So Tesla aims to continue leveraging their branding and Elon Musk's persona as a key advantage over Chinese automakers. However, over the longer term, the planned new manufacturing systems and Model 2 launch could represent Tesla's next 'moment' to re...

They are also building one in Brazil and using Mexico to export to the US market. This global manufacturing expansion allows them to reduce tariffs and transport costs when entering new markets. The Chinese companies also have to tailor their offerings to meet differing regulations across markets in Europe, as well as varied consumer habits and weather conditions. They are entering partnerships with companies like Volkswagen to navigate the local landscape. And their ability to produce affordable, high quality EVs allows them to export significant volumes from China to other markets and still be cost competitive, even if they face higher tariffs or lose EV subsidies. Question: Is the strategy of Chinese EV carmakers similar to what they did in the solar panels market to beat out the competitors? The strategy of Chinese EV carmakers is not exactly the same as what they did in the solar panels market. There is some protectionism and vested interests on both the Chinese side and the European side that shape the tactics being deployed. For example, while Europe is launching probes into Chinese companies, European automakers also have large markets and operations in China that they want to protect. So it will be a balancing act between the trade confrontations and not wanting too severe repercussions. The dynamics are also different with EVs because unlike solar panels, vehicles have much more complex regulations and consumer preferences across various markets. So while Chinese EVs can compete well on affordability, building awareness and tailoring to local regulations and habits remains an ongoing challenge as they enter more markets globally. However, we are seeing increased availability and exports of Chinese EVs, with companies like BYD rapidly setting up plants globally. So there is momentum but it may not be as straightforward as what happened with solar panels given the complexities of the automotive industry across different markets. Question: How is BYD performing in the US market given the trade war tariffs? BYD has been in the US since 2010 or 2011 when they set up their headquarters. They are already producing electric buses in California, so they have local employees and American jobs.

[Chunk: 1335]

This helps them keep up with the latest innovations and adopt new technologies quickly into their vehicles. For market penetration, Chinese brands are entering multiple global markets and exporting EVs to establish presence and build brand awareness. BYD now has plants in 6 countries beyond China. Meeting various regulations across different markets remains a hurdle. Strategies involve working with local partners, building out charging networks, and pricing vehicles competitively enough to absorb increased costs from tariffs or taxes. Success comes from tailoring vehicles and branding to local consumer preferences. Volume and profitability are still driven by the China market while global expansion continues gradually. Question: What kind of strategies are the Chinese EV manufacturers thinking about for global market entry? The Chinese EV manufacturers are thinking about several strategies for entering global markets. These include building brand awareness, setting up local manufacturing plants, using other markets like Mexico as a springboard to enter the US market, working with local partners to meet regulations and consumer preferences, and exporting affordable EVs from China to compete on price. Specifically, Nio is focused on building its brand, charging network, and battery swap infrastructure as it expands, rather than immediately aiming for high sales volumes. BYD already has 5 global plants and is building a 6th in Indonesia.

He attended a US-China Automotive Council conference in New York City when he was a history teacher and it gave him the idea to start an English newsletter for the western audience about the Chinese auto industry. I helped him with mailing out the physical newsletters while sleeping in the living room of our small apartment. After graduating from college in 2000 with a mechanical engineering degree, I went back to China to help my dad on the ground with his "China Auto Review" newsletter. This was right before China was joining the WTO, so foreign automotive companies were setting up joint ventures to start selling cars in China. I've now been in Beijing for over 20 years since then, publishing a monthly print magazine on the Chinese auto market called "China Auto Review" until August 2020 when we had to stop due to the pandemic. Question: What are the lessons you have learned that you can share with my audience? The key lessons I have learned from my career covering the Chinese auto industry that I can share are:
Interacting directly with Chinese and foreign automotive companies to understand their different processes and cultures has been invaluable. I've been very fortunate to visit their headquarters, factories, and meet with executives, engineers, and other employees to gain firsthand insights. My bicultural background as a Chinese American has enabled me to easily switch between and understand both Chinese and American cultures. Not everyone has this ability to immerse themselves in two very different cultures.

[Subject: How the antitrust lawsuit against NVDA will impact it, and other companies]

Hi Sumin,
Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, approved in 2020, is under scrutiny in China for potentially violating antitrust rules. The $7 billion deal is being looked over by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China. The potential impacts - both through NVDA's market cap and as a microcosm of China-US relations - are far reaching.
We used our agentic AI tool - Alfa‚Ñ¢ - to create an automation that reads the news, every filing in the Russell 1000 and outputs the potential impacts of this suit and the stocks affected. Here‚Äôs the report Alfa‚Ñ¢ created, or, the Alfa‚Ñ¢ Angle.
Brainstormed impacts of a Chinese antitrust lawsuit against NVDA
Nvidia's Mellanox Acquisition Under Chinese Antitrust Scrutiny
- The Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, focusing on its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company specializing in networking technology. 
- The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China is scrutinizing whether Nvidia has adhered to the conditions set during the 2020 approval of the Mellanox deal, which required Nvidia to treat Chinese companies on par with others globally.
- This investigation is part of a broader context of escalating tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. The investigation is seen as a retaliatory measure against recent U.S. actions aimed at restricting China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. 
- These U.S. measures include export controls that limit the sale of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, which has significantly impacted Nvidia's revenue from the Chinese market. Despite these restrictions, Nvidia continues to generate substantial revenue from less advanced chips that it is still permitted to sell in China.
- The conditions imposed by Chinese regulators during the Mellanox acquisition included commitments to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. Nvidia was also required to allow customers and distributors to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The investigation will assess Nvidia's compliance with these commitments, including whether Mellanox has been revealing new product details to rivals within 90 days of their launch, as stipulated.
- This probe is part of a larger pattern of regulatory actions by China, which has previously targeted other foreign technology firms in response to international trade tensions. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for Nvidia's operations in China and its global business strategy.
Impact on Nvidia's AI Chip Market Dominance
- The Chinese antitrust investigation into Nvidia poses a significant threat to the company's dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia, which has been a leader in AI chip technology, accounting for 90% of global sales by the end of last year, is now under s...

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Your task is to analyze emails for inclusion in a Research Management System (RMS) used by investment professionals for market research, company analysis, and investment decisions.

KEY EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Financial Research Value: Does this contain unique insights, data, or analysis useful for investment decisions?
2. Source Relevance: Is the sender a credible source of financial/investment information?
3. Content Type: Does the content fall into key categories like market analysis, company research, or industry insights?

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- Primary Analysis: Identify the core purpose and sender context
- Content Analysis: Evaluate specific financial/investment content
- Value Assessment: Determine usefulness for investment research
- Category Matching: Align with defined inclusion/exclusion categories

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Emails from investment banks, research providers, and financial services carry higher weight
- Internal discussions about investments or market analysis should be included
- Technical, administrative, or general business emails should typically be excluded
- Context matters: even routine emails may be valuable if they contain investment insights

Your classifications must be thorough, consistent, and focused on investment research value."""

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Generate questions and answers that enable effective retrieval and analysis of investment-relevant information from a large database of financial emails. The Q&A pairs should support natural investment research workflows and work across multiple languages (English, Korean, Japanese).

QUESTION PRINCIPLES:
1. Natural Time Frames
   - Use periods like "in 2024", "during Q3", "early 2025"
   - Avoid overly specific dates
   - Enable reasonable search windows

2. Clear Entity References
   - Companies and tickers
   - Investment banks and research firms
   - Market trends and themes
   - Products and strategies

3. Question Types
   - Simple Factual: "What did [Company] announce about [Topic] in [Period]?"
   - Synthesis: "Summarize [Company]'s [Actions] in [Period]"
   - Timeline: "How did [Topic/Metric] develop during [Period]?"
   - Cross-Reference: "How did [Event A] relate to [Event B]?"
   - Numerical: "What were the key figures from [Event]?"
   - Impact: "What effects did [Event] have on [Metric]?"
   - Source-Specific: "What did [Source] report about [Topic]?"
   - Comparative: "How does [Company A] compare to [Company B]?"

ANSWER PRINCIPLES:
1. Conciseness
   - Keep to 1-2 sentences
   - Start with core information
   - Include key metrics when available

2. Factual Focus
   - Stick to information in the email
   - Include specific numbers and data
   - Avoid speculation or analysis
   - Use clear financial terminology

3. Multi-Language Support
   - Answers should work regardless of source language
   - Maintain consistency in terminology
   - Consider cross-language retrievability

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Would this question help investors find relevant information?
2. Is the answer specific and fact-based?
3. Does it support natural research workflows?
4. Would it work effectively in a RAG system?
5. Does it enable connection of related information?

Remember: Focus on creating questions that support effective information retrieval and answers that provide clear, actionable investment insights."""

2. Synthesis ("Summarize [Company]'s [Actions] in [Period]")
3. Timeline ("How did [Topic/Metric] develop during [Period]?")
4. Cross-Reference ("How did [Event A] relate to [Event B]?")
5. Numerical ("What were the key figures from [Event] in [Period]?")
6. Impact ("What effects did [Event] have on [Metric/Market]?")
7. Source-Specific ("What did [Source] report about [Topic]?")
8. Comparative ("How does [Company A]'s [Metric] compare to [Company B]?")
