Hi Sumin,

[Chunk: 1333]
[DOCX Content:]
Attending industry events and trade shows provides opportunities to learn a lot, especially from mid-level engineers who are often more willing to share detailed technical knowledge. Unless you spend time on the ground in China, driving various EV models, testing charging infrastructure and connectivity, and experiencing autonomous driving capabilities, it's very difficult for Westerners to truly comprehend the affordable quality and relentless competitive pace of innovation happening in the Chinese auto industry. Question: Can you provide a comprehensive overview of the global EV market and the total market opportunity? If we look at from a 30,000 foot level, light vehicle sales globally is about 80.0 million a year. And China does about 30.0 million, but that's including shipment overseas. Last year, it was 9.5 million NEVs shipped from China. If we look at the 3 big regions - China, Europe, and North America - China is by far the leader. Last year was, like, a third of vehicles were NEVs in China. Europe a little bit less, maybe a little bit less than 20%. I think US last year was not quite 10%, close to 10%. So basically 50% let's say the NEVs are from China. They're shipped from China.

[Chunk: 1334]
[DOCX Content:]
That's basically the current kind of landscape. Question: Can you share the background for some of the key manufacturers in China, such as BYD, Nio, and Xiaomi? BYD is the largest Chinese EV manufacturer. It was founded by a chemical engineer about 30 years ago and started out as a battery supplier for companies like Nokia. They have built their expertise in batteries over the past 20-30 years. When we talk about the Chinese EV makers like BYD and NIO, they are exporting and selling in many more countries now compared to just 3 or 4 years ago. For example, BYD now has production plants set up globally in places like Hungary, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. Nio, XPeng, and Li Auto are considered the top 3 "smart EV startups" in China. They were all founded about 10 years ago by tech entrepreneurs and are known for their focus on technology. For example, Nio is known for its battery swapping stations, XPeng for its autonomous driving capabilities, and Li Auto for extended range electric vehicles. Xiaomi recently launched its first EV model that aims to compete with premium models like the Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S, despite likely being priced under 300,000 RMB which is a very competitive part of the EV market in China. Question: How do you assess the competitive dynamics between the Chinese EV makers like BYD versus Tesla? I often say that why the Chinese have gotten to where they are are several t's - affordability, quality, availability, and agility. The availability of Chinese EVs, not only in China but elsewhere in the world, was an important driver behind their rise over the last 2 years. And then there's the China speed - how fast they iterate their models and vehicles and how fast they launch multiple models within a short period of time. This speed is something the foreign automakers really can't compete with. When it comes to Tesla, they have been able to stay strong with only 2 products - the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla has a huge aura for their brand, as evidenced by the recent Cybertruck tour craziness across 8 cities in China. This brand pull is still very strong for them. But I think the Chinese automakers are covering all different market segments, from small micro vehicles to $150,000 premium vehicles. The Chinese companies are also becoming more confident in launching premium brands as they now have more technical prowess and innovations that are starting to appear first in China before anywhere else. This relentlessness of the Chinese companies is not only pushing the foreign automakers, but becoming a benchmark that these companies need to catch up to. That's why you see partnerships emerging between companies like Volkswagen and XPeng. I think we're in the midst of a prolonged price war that will continue until brands without the financial capabilities are driven out. This war is so cutthroat that even BYD, as the market leader, has had to lower prices and accept lower margins. Question: What's the one thing you know abou...

This is very important. At the same time, behind the scenes they are preparing to enter the passenger vehicle market. They recently brought over some U8 SUVs into the US for local testing and to potentially show them to investors and dealerships. I have even driven BYD's Han sedan and Tang SUV models here in the US. So they have been doing some local testing and are looking for the right moment to make an announcement about entering the US passenger vehicle market, either by directly importing from China and eating the current 27.5% tariffs, or using Mexico as a free trade springboard to produce vehicles there and export them tariff-free to North America under NAFTA. This latter approach may irk the US given the tensions with China, so there will likely be a lot of scrutiny. But one way or another, I think it's just a matter of time before BYD enters the US passenger vehicle market alongside other Chinese brands. Question: Does BYD have its own car operating system, its own AI, or self-driving car division? When you talk about BYD, you think of batteries because that's where they started out as a battery company. In terms of robotics, AI, and the vertical integration of autonomous driving and operating systems, BYD is slightly behind other companies. That's why you're seeing collaborations like BYD working with DJI, the drone company that is becoming a force in driver assistance and ADAS features. BYD recently held an event showing their R&D prowess and they are catching up on the autonomous driving aspect. However, I would still say Tesla is probably ahead in claiming and bragging about AI with things like Dojo, Optimus, and Elon Musk's various other startups. But at the same time, BYD's globalization and the tsunami of multiple different EV models hitting different markets is more prevalent than what we see from Tesla. Question: How would Tesla be adapting their strategies in response to the growing presence of Chinese EV makers? Tesla would continue their tactic of making incremental improvements and lacking models in the near term, such as potentially launching the Model 2 next year to compete in China. However, it remains to be seen whether the Model 2 could successfully compete on affordability compared to Chinese EVs. Tesla is also using China as an export base by ramping up production capacity with plans to invest $10 billion in CapEx in China in 2023. This includes expanding the Shanghai factory which was mentioned a couple dozen times in Tesla's recent 10k filing. So Tesla sees China as crucial to their global growth strategy. At the same time, Tesla is benefiting from the strong brand aura and customer excitement in China, as evidenced by the recent Cybertruck tour drawing massive crowds. So Tesla aims to continue leveraging their branding and Elon Musk's persona as a key advantage over Chinese automakers. However, over the longer term, the planned new manufacturing systems and Model 2 launch could represent Tesla's next 'moment' to re...

They are also building one in Brazil and using Mexico to export to the US market. This global manufacturing expansion allows them to reduce tariffs and transport costs when entering new markets. The Chinese companies also have to tailor their offerings to meet differing regulations across markets in Europe, as well as varied consumer habits and weather conditions. They are entering partnerships with companies like Volkswagen to navigate the local landscape. And their ability to produce affordable, high quality EVs allows them to export significant volumes from China to other markets and still be cost competitive, even if they face higher tariffs or lose EV subsidies. Question: Is the strategy of Chinese EV carmakers similar to what they did in the solar panels market to beat out the competitors? The strategy of Chinese EV carmakers is not exactly the same as what they did in the solar panels market. There is some protectionism and vested interests on both the Chinese side and the European side that shape the tactics being deployed. For example, while Europe is launching probes into Chinese companies, European automakers also have large markets and operations in China that they want to protect. So it will be a balancing act between the trade confrontations and not wanting too severe repercussions. The dynamics are also different with EVs because unlike solar panels, vehicles have much more complex regulations and consumer preferences across various markets. So while Chinese EVs can compete well on affordability, building awareness and tailoring to local regulations and habits remains an ongoing challenge as they enter more markets globally. However, we are seeing increased availability and exports of Chinese EVs, with companies like BYD rapidly setting up plants globally. So there is momentum but it may not be as straightforward as what happened with solar panels given the complexities of the automotive industry across different markets. Question: How is BYD performing in the US market given the trade war tariffs? BYD has been in the US since 2010 or 2011 when they set up their headquarters. They are already producing electric buses in California, so they have local employees and American jobs.

This helps them keep up with the latest innovations and adopt new technologies quickly into their vehicles. For market penetration, Chinese brands are entering multiple global markets and exporting EVs to establish presence and build brand awareness. BYD now has plants in 6 countries beyond China. Meeting various regulations across different markets remains a hurdle. Strategies involve working with local partners, building out charging networks, and pricing vehicles competitively enough to absorb increased costs from tariffs or taxes. Success comes from tailoring vehicles and branding to local consumer preferences. Volume and profitability are still driven by the China market while global expansion continues gradually. Question: What kind of strategies are the Chinese EV manufacturers thinking about for global market entry? The Chinese EV manufacturers are thinking about several strategies for entering global markets. These include building brand awareness, setting up local manufacturing plants, using other markets like Mexico as a springboard to enter the US market, working with local partners to meet regulations and consumer preferences, and exporting affordable EVs from China to compete on price. Specifically, Nio is focused on building its brand, charging network, and battery swap infrastructure as it expands, rather than immediately aiming for high sales volumes. BYD already has 5 global plants and is building a 6th in Indonesia.

He attended a US-China Automotive Council conference in New York City when he was a history teacher and it gave him the idea to start an English newsletter for the western audience about the Chinese auto industry. I helped him with mailing out the physical newsletters while sleeping in the living room of our small apartment. After graduating from college in 2000 with a mechanical engineering degree, I went back to China to help my dad on the ground with his "China Auto Review" newsletter. This was right before China was joining the WTO, so foreign automotive companies were setting up joint ventures to start selling cars in China. I've now been in Beijing for over 20 years since then, publishing a monthly print magazine on the Chinese auto market called "China Auto Review" until August 2020 when we had to stop due to the pandemic. Question: What are the lessons you have learned that you can share with my audience? The key lessons I have learned from my career covering the Chinese auto industry that I can share are:
Interacting directly with Chinese and foreign automotive companies to understand their different processes and cultures has been invaluable. I've been very fortunate to visit their headquarters, factories, and meet with executives, engineers, and other employees to gain firsthand insights. My bicultural background as a Chinese American has enabled me to easily switch between and understand both Chinese and American cultures. Not everyone has this ability to immerse themselves in two very different cultures.

Hi Sumin,
Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, approved in 2020, is under scrutiny in China for potentially violating antitrust rules. The $7 billion deal is being looked over by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China. The potential impacts - both through NVDA's market cap and as a microcosm of China-US relations - are far reaching.
We used our agentic AI tool - Alfa™ - to create an automation that reads the news, every filing in the Russell 1000 and outputs the potential impacts of this suit and the stocks affected. Here’s the report Alfa™ created, or, the Alfa™ Angle.
Brainstormed impacts of a Chinese antitrust lawsuit against NVDA
Nvidia's Mellanox Acquisition Under Chinese Antitrust Scrutiny
- The Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, focusing on its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company specializing in networking technology. 
- The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China is scrutinizing whether Nvidia has adhered to the conditions set during the 2020 approval of the Mellanox deal, which required Nvidia to treat Chinese companies on par with others globally.
- This investigation is part of a broader context of escalating tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. The investigation is seen as a retaliatory measure against recent U.S. actions aimed at restricting China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. 
- These U.S. measures include export controls that limit the sale of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, which has significantly impacted Nvidia's revenue from the Chinese market. Despite these restrictions, Nvidia continues to generate substantial revenue from less advanced chips that it is still permitted to sell in China.
- The conditions imposed by Chinese regulators during the Mellanox acquisition included commitments to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. Nvidia was also required to allow customers and distributors to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The investigation will assess Nvidia's compliance with these commitments, including whether Mellanox has been revealing new product details to rivals within 90 days of their launch, as stipulated.
- This probe is part of a larger pattern of regulatory actions by China, which has previously targeted other foreign technology firms in response to international trade tensions. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for Nvidia's operations in China and its global business strategy.
Impact on Nvidia's AI Chip Market Dominance
- The Chinese antitrust investigation into Nvidia poses a significant threat to the company's dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia, which has been a leader in AI chip technology, accounting for 90% of global sales by the end of last year, is now under s...

FADU is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in datacenters, which are growing in
demand due to the explosive data increase from cloud, AI/Big data, 5G, autonomous driving
etc. FADU core products are SSD Controllers used in datacenters. In datacenters, Solid State
Drives(SSDs), which are high-performance data storage devices based on NAND memory
semiconductors, are rapidly replacing HDDs, the traditional mechanical data storage device. NAND memory has the advantage of being a non-volatile semiconductor and very low cost,
but it suffers from slow speeds and poor durability. Due to these characteristics of NAND, the role of the SSD Controller, the brain of the SSD
module, is critical to ensuring the high levels of performance, reliability, and low power/low
thermal features that hyperscale datacenters require. FADU is the design company of this SSD
Controller. Our flagship products are the best-in-class performing PCIe NVMe enterprise SSD Controller
Solutions and enterprise SSDs(SSD ODMs) powered by our controllers, which are compatible with
all NAND memory products from different companies to deliver the highest performance in all
SSD metrics, including reliability and power efficiency etc. About FADU INC.

Hey Sumin, 
Welcome to this week’s Exploding Topics Pro report. 
In this report… 
Early bird companies: Spectral AI, Nivoda, Codeyoung, Bird Buddy. 
Tomorrow’s products today: 3D book nook, revenue based finance, clove water, ebike battery bag. 
Do you have any feedback? We’d love to hear what you think. Just respond to let us know. 
Early Bird Companies 
Spectral AI (website , search trend )
Spectral AI is a wound imaging startup. 
It uses multispectral imaging to take scans of wounds across various different wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum. 
AI then analyzes the images to give clinicians a prediction of how the wound will heal, with the benefit of information not visible to the human eye. 
The DeepView artificial intelligence model has been trained on 263B data points from a clinical database. 
Spectral reported $8.2M in research and development revenue in Q3 2024, mainly received through work done under contracts with the US government. 
What’s next:
Spectral AI is part of the Healthcare AI meta trend. 
The global healthcare automation market is projected to be worth $119.5B by 2033. 
And wide adoption of AI in the US healthcare system could save between $200B and $360B per year. 
Medical imaging has been a strong area of innovation, with more than 700 of the 950 FDA-approved medical AI devices relating to radiology. Here are a couple of examples: 
Lunit is a South Korean imaging startup dedicated to improving cancer scans. It acquired breast scanning business Volpara last year for $193M . 
RapidAI has analyzed 14 million scans in a bid to improve vascular and neurovascular care. It is used in over 2.2K hospitals . 
Nivoda (website , search trend )
Nivoda is an online B2B diamond database. 
It allows jewellery retailers to offer an extensive collection of over 2M natural and lab-grown diamonds to customers, without taking on any inventory risk. 
Orders from multiple suppliers are consolidated into a single invoice and shipment, and quality-checked by Nivoda. 
The platform added colored gemstones in 2023, with more than 80K now available. 
Nivoda secured a $51M Series C funding round in November, just 6 months after raising a $30M Series B round. 
What’s next:
Nivoda is part of the Diamond Tech meta trend. 
Diamonds are a $100B industry worldwide. And 18% of the total diamond supply is now lab-grown. 
Structurally identical to natural diamonds but grown in controlled conditions, the market value of all lab-grown diamonds is forecast to hit $59.5B by 2032. 
VRAI exclusively sells lab-grown diamonds. It is the consumer arm of Diamond Foundry, which has raised $515M in total funding. 
Away from lab-grown diamonds, there have also been advances in precision cutting techniques and AI diamond grading . 
Synova sells diamond cutting systems which use lasers guided by microscopically-thin jets of water. More than 500 machines have been delivered worldwide. 
Codeyoung (website , search trend )
Codeyoung provides 1:1 online tuition for childr...
